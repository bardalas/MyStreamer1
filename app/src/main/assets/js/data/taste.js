/* ---------- what a profile likes ----------
   Learnt from what the viewer does, never asked: a title's page opened says a little, a title played says
   more, a favourite says most. Each adds to the title's genres, and to its director and first actors; and
   old liking fades a little with every new sign, so what is suggested follows a viewer whose taste moves.
   It is kept with the profile (core/store.js 'taste') - each member of the household is learnt apart.
   From it come the rows "Recommended for you" and "Because you watched ..." (screens/home.js): the popular
   and the best-rated titles of the genres the profile likes, each scored by how much of what it likes it
   meets, and none it has already seen. They are asked through the catalogue path like any row, so a kids
   profile gets only what it may watch (data/kids.js). */
