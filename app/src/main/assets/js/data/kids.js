/* ---------- the kids profile ----------
   With the profile on, the app shows a child only what is made for children, everywhere at once: the
   rows, Movies and Series, the library and search all ask the catalogues through catalogFetch
   (data/addons.js), which keeps only the titles that pass isKidSafe. What cannot be judged - live
   channels, the broadcasters' own sites, the Israeli catalogues, which carry no genres - is not offered
   at all (app.js keeps those screens out of reach), and a title opened from anywhere else is checked
   again on its own page. Leaving or loosening the profile asks for the household's parent code (below).

   The catalogues say nothing about age, only up to three genres. So: a film is for children when it is
   animation or a family film and none of its genres is one children are kept from; a series needs the
   family genre, or a place on the list below - animation alone is anime and satire as often as it is
   cartoons. The block list holds the animation made for grown-ups that the rules would let through.

   A teenager's profile (14, 16, 18 - core/settings.js AGE_LEVELS) is not a child's: nothing is kept from
   it for its genres. A title is judged by its rating (data/ratings.js: the certificate it was given here,
   or abroad) against the profile's age; one with no rating known passes - but at 14 not a horror film. */
