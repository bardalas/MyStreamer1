# VEO — Android & Android TV media app

## Overview
Android/Android TV frontend for Stremio-compatible add-ons (Cinemeta, Torrentio, and others the
user installs), with native Media3/ExoPlayer playback and a built-in BitTorrent engine (FrostWire
jlibtorrent). Hebrew RTL UI. Formerly named **המקרן / HaMakren / "Booth"** — renamed to **VEO** in
0.33.0 (see `CHANGELOG.md`); `applicationId` changed `com.booth.player` → `com.veo.player` as part
of that rename, done pre-launch so it is a clean switch, not an in-place update path.

The whole UI is a page in a WebView, talking to a thin native layer over a JavaScript bridge
(`window.BoothAndroid` — **the bridge object's name was deliberately left unrenamed**, see Gotchas).
Native code exists only where the WebView cannot do the job itself: video/DRM playback, torrent
downloading, a local HTTP file server to feed torrent data to ExoPlayer, and an off-screen window for
sites that turn plain requests away.

## Files

The page is a set of ES modules, served over https by the app itself (see *The page's address*), so
it needs no build step: edit a file and reload.

```

    screens/            one file per screen, each exporting its view function
      home.js detail.js search.js library.js live.js broadcasters.js settings.js addons.js
```

A module may use anything from a layer below it (core → data → providers → ui → screens → app.js);
`app.js` is the only place that knows the whole. Nothing is global: what one module needs from
another it imports, and **the import lines are derived, never hand-kept** —

```
python tools/rewire.py            rewrite every import line from what each module actually uses
python tools/rewire.py --check    fail if any of them is out of date
```

Move a function from one file to another and run it; the graph is correct again. State that one
module keeps and another changes is never assigned across a module boundary (an ES import is
read-only, which is the point): the owner exports a small setter instead — `setSettings`,
`setPlaylists`, `setAddonUrls`, `forgetRtv`, `noteOpened`.

- `app/src/main/java/com/veo/player/`
  - `MainActivity.kt` — hosts the WebView, serves the page over https, and holds the `BoothAndroid`
    bridge (play/torrent/subtitle/fetch/update calls) and the in-app self-update.
  - `PlayerActivity.kt` — the ExoPlayer screen: VOD and live TV, the banner, the panels, the keys.
  - `SiteReader.kt` — the off-screen window that reads a broadcaster's site (see *A broadcaster's
    own site*), queueing one page at a time.
  - `Skin.kt` — the colours and direction the page last chose, as the player wears them.
  - `BrowserActivity.kt` — a plain in-app browser for sites that must be used, not read.
  - `TorrentEngine.kt` — jlibtorrent: one session, sequential download, the opening piece first.
  - `StreamServer.kt` — a local `http://127.0.0.1` server that serves the partially-downloaded file
    to ExoPlayer, and asks the swarm for the pieces a jump landed on.
  - `Subtitles.kt` — Hebrew subtitle lookup (Wizdom, OpenSubtitles), matched against the release.
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` — the only build path that produces a signed APK (see
  Building). Also builds an unsigned debug APK with x86_64 torrent natives for PC emulator testing.
- `tools/setup-tv-emulator.ps1` — one-shot Windows setup for a local Android TV emulator (SDK
  command-line tools + an Android TV x86_64 image), so the app can be tested without a real box.

## Architecture

### The WebView/native split
The page owns all UI and business logic. It calls into Kotlin only for what a WebView
genuinely cannot do:
- `playUrl` / `playTorrent` / `playLive` / `playChannels` / `playDrm` / `playVod` — hand a stream
  to `PlayerActivity`.
- `fetchText` — a fetch proxy for the JS side, used where a site's CORS policy or a custom
  User-Agent/Referer would block a direct `fetch()` from the page.
- `isTv` — tells the page whether this is a television (drives `IS_TV_DEVICE` in `core/settings.js`; the
  D-pad navigation model is gated on this, not on the *chosen layout* — see Gotchas).
- `updateApp` — downloads a new release APK with progress reported back through the same status
  card the torrent engine uses, then launches the system package installer.
- `openSite` / `openExternal` / `openYouTube` / `showKeyboard` / `cancelTorrent`.

### Interface language and direction (`js/i18n.js`)
The app's own text is `STRINGS.he` / `STRINGS.en` (one flat table per language, in the `<script>` that
follows the static markup) read through `tr(key, vars)`; static markup uses `data-i18n`,
`data-i18n-ph` and `data-i18n-aria`. `settings.uiLang` picks the language; it also sets `<html lang dir>`,
so layout follows (`dirOf`). `missingStrings()` in the console lists keys one language lacks. Adding a
language = one table + one row in `UI_LANGS`. **Never name anything `t`** in new code that also calls
`tr()`; the file has many local `t` variables (that is why the function is `tr`).
The player draws its own views, so `syncNativeTheme()` (in `applySettings`) hands the current skin's
colours and the direction to `BoothAndroid.setTheme`, which keeps them in the `veo` preferences;
`PlayerActivity.applySkin()` paints the banner, the channel list and the error panel from them and puts
the list on the side the layout runs from.
`NAMES` holds names of things add-ons describe in English (genres, types, catalogues): shown as they
come unless a table has them. `settings.lang` is a different thing: Hebrew vs original *titles and
summaries* from Wikidata. CSS mirrors physical offsets with `--flip` (1 in RTL, -1 in LTR); the D-pad
"forward" key is `FWD()` (ArrowLeft in RTL). Still Hebrew-only: the Channels/Live TV pages, the library
and search pages, the native player's strings and status messages.

### What was watched (`js/data/watch.js`)
`progress[videoId]` holds `{t, d, at, metaId, type, name, poster, done}` and is written by
`window.boothProgress` (the player, through the bridge) and by the in-page player. `done` (watched to
within a minute of the end) is what puts a tick on a poster and keeps the title out of "continue
watching"; it used to be a `delete`, so a finished film left no trace at all. `indexProgress()` maps
a title to the newest thing watched under it, so a series shows its last episode; a series never gets
a tick, because one finished episode is not a watched series. `pruneProgress()` keeps 400.

### Starting and moving in a torrent (`TorrentEngine`, `StreamServer`, `PlayerActivity`)
The magnet is added to the session **once** (`session.download(magnet, dir, SEQUENTIAL_DOWNLOAD)`) and the
details are waited for on that same handle: `fetchMagnet` used a session of its own and threw its peers
away, so the download began by finding them all over again. Playback waits only for the piece under the
opening (`START_BUFFER_BYTES` is half a megabyte, i.e. one piece) plus the last piece, which usually holds
the index; everything else arrives while it plays. A jump cancels the stale piece deadlines and raises the
priority of the pieces where the reader landed (`StreamServer.awaitPiece`), and the player asks for the
previous sync point rather than an exact frame. In the activity, arrows do not seek: they move `scrubTo`,
the banner shows where they are heading, and `commitScrub` makes the one seek 700ms after they stop.

### The page's address (`MainActivity`)
The page is served to itself by `WebViewAssetLoader` at `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/assets/`,
not opened as `file://`. A file has no origin, so every iframe and every fetch from it arrived with none:
YouTube answered embeds with "error 153" and some add-ons refused the request outright. Because storage
belongs to an origin, `migrateStore()` carries the old `file://` keys over on the first run at the new
address (through the same hidden window as `siteExtract`, reading `export.html`) and reloads. It is called
from `boot()`, not at the top of the script: what it uses is declared further down.

### Motion (`css/motion.css`, `js/ui/tvnav.js`)
One ease and three durations (`--ease`, `--quick/--travel/--settle`) drive everything. Only transform and
opacity are animated - a television's GPU carries those and nothing else - which is why the blanket
"no animation on TV" rule is gone. The focus marker is a single fixed `#halo` that is moved (and resized)
to the focused element on `focusin`; while the page scrolls it is moved without its transition, so it
sticks to its element instead of chasing it. Posters are excluded: they grow when chosen, and a rectangle
measured before the growth would always land behind them.

### A broadcaster's own site (`js/core/bridge.js` + `SiteReader.kt`)
Kan puts its whole catalogue in its HTML but answers a plain request with a bot check. `siteExtract(url,
reader, id)` therefore opens the page in an off-screen WebView - which passes the check by being a browser -
and runs `reader` there: the body of a function of the document that returns JSON. Only the answer crosses
back, never the markup. The window stays for five minutes, so every further page of the same site is a
same-origin `fetch` inside it. `sitePull()` calls it inside the app and runs the very same reader over a
directly fetched page outside it, so there is one implementation of every extractor.

### The featured title and its taste (`js/ui/hero.js`)
`pickFeatured()` chooses the title that takes the top of a listing: it wants artwork, a description and
(when any row offers one) a trailer, remembers the last twelve in `heroSeen` so the same one does not come
back, and returns null rather than letting a row of bare Wikidata entries claim the spot - a plain title
takes it after six seconds if nothing better arrived. `renderHero()` then starts the taste: a muted
YouTube embed behind the words, `pointer-events:none` and `tabindex="-1"` so the remote never lands in it.
It is only faded in once the player reports itself playing (`enablejsapi` + a `listening` handshake);
if nothing answers within eight seconds the frame is removed and the artwork stays. `endTaste()` clears it
on every navigation and whenever the app goes to the background.

### Sources that are not streams
WatchHub answers with the subscription service a title is on, as a stream carrying only an `externalUrl`.
`parseStream` marks those `external`: they stay out of the ranking and out of "is this title available",
and render as "Watch on …" buttons that open the service (never handed to the player, which cannot play a
web page). A torrent with no seeders ranks below everything but is still listed - for a rare documentary
it is the only thing there is.

### Browsing model (`js/data/catalogs.js`, `js/data/sort.js`, `js/ui/origins.js`, `js/screens/catalog.js`)
The rail lists *collections* (All, Movies, Series, and `CATEGORIES`: Israeli, Kids, Documentaries). Home
and the categories carry the pills (`SORT_GROUPS`: Genre, Service, Year, Rating, Sort; state in
`pageFilters`); when any pill is on, `gridFrom()` shows one ranked grid and states how many titles, how
sorted and from which sources; a genre also pulls Cinemeta's popular/top-rated titles of that genre
(`withGenreRows`). Genres are not a page any more (`viewGenre` just sets the filter, for old links).
- **Movies / Series** (`screens/home.js` `viewType`) are for browsing: a strip of *source tabs* (`.srctabs`:
  All + every source in `ORIGINS` - the streaming services, Kan, Keshet, Reshet, the film archive, the
  Israeli catalogues) turns row 0 (`retune()`), then continue-watching, then `typeRows` (popular, best,
  Israeli, the broadcasters' rows, genres). A row of sources is `{origins: [ids], type}` (`fillRow`).
- **The library** of a type (`#/all/movie|series`, `screens/catalog.js` - *not* `screens/library.js`, which
  is the viewer's favourites) is for finding: every title of the type from every source in one grid, under
  pills of its own (`new Filters('libSort:<type>')`, so they never turn Home into a grid), with a side
  panel on the focused title (picture, facts, plot, then a quiet taste).
- A service is marked **once, on the cover** (`.svcbadge`), never beside the name. Its mark there and in the
  tabs is a one-colour glyph: `svc/g/<id>.png`, made from the logos by `tools/svc_glyphs.py` and drawn as a
  CSS mask filled with `currentColor` (so it follows the skin and the focus); their width/height ratios
  live in `GLYPH_RATIO` in `data/services.js` - re-run the script and update them when a logo changes.

### Settings and the kids profile (`js/screens/settings.js`, `js/data/kids.js`)
Settings is a menu of pages (general, playback, home, look, live, kids, about) written into the hash
(`#/settings/<tab>`). Every setting is one `.sline`: name, a few words, and its value; a choice of two
toggles, a longer one opens `pickFrom` (`ui/sheets.js`). The choices are one table, `PREFS` - most live in
`settings` (`setSetting`); the quality is `ui/sources.js`'s own (`setPrefQ`), the subtitles' size is the
player's (`BoothAndroid.get/setSubScale`). Every control carries a `data-fid`, and `paintSettings(fid)`
puts the remote back on it after any repaint; Back inside a page goes to its menu entry first
(`boothBack`). What cannot be undone asks for a second press (`.sline.warn`).
The **kids profile** (`settings.kids`) is enforced in a few places, not per screen: every catalogue answer
passes `forKids` inside `catalogFetch` (a film: family, or animation beside a child's genre; a series:
family or the `SERIES` list; never the `DENY` genres or the `BLOCK` list); the sources are the streaming
services only (`originsFor`); `route()` keeps it to `KIDS_ROUTES`; a title page checks `kidsMayOpen`; search
judges each result by its own meta. Live TV, the broadcasters, YouTube, web pages and updates are out of
reach (JS, and natively: `MainActivity.kidsProfile()` reads the `kids` pref `syncNativeTheme` writes).
Leaving it needs the four-digit code (salted hash, five tries then a five-minute lock) or a grown-up's
sum; a reset keeps the profile on. The genres are the only age signal the catalogues give - when an
adult title slips through, add its IMDb id to `BLOCK`.
The app opts out of Android 16's predictive Back (`enableOnBackInvokedCallback="false"`): the page walks
its own Back ladder and the player reads the Back key, and neither is called otherwise.

### Title page and the TV screen
On the TV a series page never scrolls the page (`body.titlefit`): the header keeps its size and the
episode list fills the rest, scrolling inside itself. Play, the quality shortcuts, library and trailer are
one row (`.playrow`, one D-pad row); the long source list opens under it (`#palt`). A menu column
(`.seasonbar`, `.stabs`) no longer traps Up/Down at its ends: they lead to the row above/below.

### Boot sequence (`js/app.js`, `boot()`)
`boot()`: starts loading add-ons, races them against a 6-second timeout, renders the route with
whatever answered in time, and — if add-ons were still loading — re-renders home once they finish
so a slow add-on doesn't leave the home screen permanently empty. Then schedules `loadServices`
(streaming-service availability badges) and the update check.

### TV remote navigation model (`js/ui/tvnav.js`: `ROWS_SEL`, `tvRows`, `tvMove`)
There is no native focus system in a WebView, so one is built from scratch:
- `ROWS_SEL` is the single list of CSS selectors for every "row" the D-pad can stand on, grouped
  by screen in a comment. **Any new focusable control must be inside one of these, or the D-pad
  cannot reach it** — this was the single largest source of navigation bugs during development.
- `tvRows()` collects matches, keeps only the *innermost* match when one matched element contains
  another (so a wrapper accidentally also matching a selector can't break its child's row), and
  returns them in **document order** (not visual/CSS order — see Gotchas for why).
- `tvMove(dir)` moves within a row on Up/Down by checking whether any item sits on a different
  visual line than the active one; if none does (a genuinely horizontal strip), it falls through
  to "next row". This one check correctly handles horizontal strips, vertical lists, and grids
  without needing to special-case which kind a row is. Left/Right only move **along the visual line**:
  at a grid line's edge the back direction goes to the rail (it used to walk up into the line above).
- A "column" row (`.stabs`, `.seasonbar`, the category rail) is handled separately: Up/Down pick
  an entry *and open it*, Left/Right step into what the column controls (via `data-pane` on the
  row, e.g. `data-pane="#eps"`).
- `isTvLayout()` gates the whole system: `IS_TV_DEVICE || settings.layout === 'tv'`. The **device**
  check must never be removed — see Gotchas. Since 0.41.0 the app has one layout (`LAYOUT = 'tv'`) and
  one poster size, both re-pinned by `pinned()` in `core/settings.js`: every other layout's rules and
  strings are gone, and a caller that writes settings without them cannot drop them any more.

### Live TV (`PlayerActivity.kt`)
Channel data (`Source`) carries `num`/`logo`/`epg` (a per-channel EPG endpoint URL) sent from
`js/providers/live.js`'s `watchChannel()`. The info banner (`showBanner`/`paintBanner`/`paintNow`) shows the
channel, current programme with a progress bar, and what's next, refreshing every 30s while up.
Live playback sets `view.useController = false` (the controls would steal the D-pad), so every key is
handled in `dispatchKeyEvent`:
- **Up/Down** raise the banner and page through the channels *in the banner* (`browseBy`): the banner
  describes the channel pointed at (`shownIndex`), the video does not change; **OK** tunes to it,
  Back cancels, and paging left alone ends after 12s.
- **Hold OK** opens the channel list, a floating `ListView` over the picture (`chPanel`); OK on a row
  tunes, holding OK on a row opens that channel's catch-up. OK is decided on *release* (`okLong`) so a
  hold never also fires the short action.
- **CHANNEL_UP/DOWN and PAGE_UP/DOWN** switch straight away (up = the next number).
- **Play/Pause** pauses; **Left/Right** (and REWIND/FAST_FORWARD) step 10s back/forward, held = 60s. A
  live stream can only go back as far as its DVR window.

### Torrent playback
`TorrentEngine` reports *JSON phases* (`{"p":"buffer","peers":..,"got":..,"need":..}`) and failures as
`e:<code>`; the page words them (`torrentText` in `js/ui/torrent.js`) so the language stays the page's job.
The status bar is shown only for waits over ~0.9s. Sources are ranked in `rank()` with a penalty for big
files, because a stream starts when the first *piece* has arrived and pieces grow with the file.
The metadata comes from `fetchMagnet`, which drops the magnet's trackers — they are re-added to the
handle after `session.download`, otherwise the download finds peers through DHT alone.
**Start-up focus (the big one):** until the first pieces are in, `bufferStart` gives every other piece
priority 0 (`prioritizePieces`), then restores the file priorities. Left alone, libtorrent hands each of
dozens of slow peers a piece of its own and the *first* piece completes last: a 2 MB piece took 40-80s
with ~10 MB already downloaded. Focused, the same titles start in 6-8s on the emulator. Timeouts
(`request_timeout`, `piece_timeout`) made no difference; do not spend time there again.

### Torrent playback path
`TorrentEngine` downloads sequentially/prioritized starting from the requested byte range;
`StreamServer` exposes the partial download over local HTTP so ExoPlayer can play it like any
other HTTP source, with range requests satisfied as data arrives.

## Building and debugging locally
Gradle 9.6.0 + Android Studio's bundled JDK build the debug APK (`gradle --no-daemon :app:assembleDebug`);
`local.properties` needs `sdk.dir` with **forward slashes**. Debug builds enable WebView remote debugging:
`adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>` then attach chrome://inspect or the
DevTools protocol to see focus, DOM and console of the real TV screen.

## Building
CI is the only supported build path (it holds the release signing secrets):
```
git push origin main          # unsigned-artifact test build
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z   # signed release + GitHub Release
```
`versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` must match the pushed tag (`v$versionName`) or CI fails
the build deliberately. `versionCode` convention: `major*10000 + minor*100 + patch`.

No Gradle wrapper is committed (CI provisions Gradle 9.6.0 + JDK 17 itself via
`gradle/actions/setup-gradle`). To build locally you need your own JDK 17, Gradle, and an Android
SDK with `compileSdk 36` — none of that was present on this machine as of the VEO rename; nothing
below "structural checks + the page's JS syntax via a real JS engine" was verified locally for
that change. `tools/setup-tv-emulator.ps1` provisions an SDK (command-line tools + an Android TV
system image) for local testing in an emulator; it does not by itself give you a build toolchain
for `gradle assembleRelease` (no signing secrets exist outside CI anyway).

## Known gotchas (hard-won — re-breaking these is easy)

- **`visible()` cannot use `offsetParent`.** `offsetParent` is `null` for every
  `position:fixed` element per spec, even when plainly on screen. Three UI pieces are
  `position:fixed` (the category rail, the update card, the torrent-status card); an
  `offsetParent`-based visibility check silently makes all of them unreachable by the D-pad. The
  current `visible()` uses a `getBoundingClientRect()` size check instead — keep it that way.
- **`inset-inline-start`/`-end` are direction-relative, not "left/right".** In this RTL page,
  `inset-inline-end: 0` pins to the **left**. Getting this backwards was a real, shipped bug (the
  category rail on the wrong side). When something needs to sit on a physical side regardless of
  direction, verify against `dir="rtl"` explicitly, don't assume.
- **A `<select>` traps the D-pad.** The keydown handler deliberately lets Up/Down through to the
  native listbox when focus is on a `<select>`, so there is no way to *leave* it via D-pad — this
  directly conflicts with "Up/Down moves between rows" everywhere else in the app. Every
  multi-choice picker in the TV UI (season, live-channel group filter) is a row of buttons, not a
  `<select>`, for exactly this reason. Don't reintroduce a native `<select>` into any TV-reachable
  screen.
- **CSS `order` breaks document-order-based row sequencing.** `tvRows()` used to sort by
  `getBoundingClientRect().top`, which shuffled the moment a sticky top bar (which always reports
  `top: 0` regardless of scroll) was scrolled past — Up jumped to the top menu instead of paging
  up a long list. Panels that need a different visual order (e.g. "watching" before "episodes" on
  a title page) are ordered correctly in the **markup** instead, and `tvRows()` stays in plain
  document order. Do not swap this back to a position-based sort without solving the sticky-header
  problem first.
- **`isTvLayout()` must check the device, not the chosen layout.** It used to be
  `settings.layout === 'tv'` alone — picking "Poster wall" or "List" on an actual television
  silently turned off all D-pad navigation. `IS_TV_DEVICE` (from `BoothAndroid.isTv()`) covers the
  real device; `settings.layout === 'tv'` alone is kept only so the TV nav model can be exercised
  from a desktop browser during development.
- **A catch-up address is proven by the clock in its playlist, never by a playlist coming back.**
  The RaspberryTV panel answers *every* spelling of an archive address with a valid master playlist -
  its live one. Measured: of nine shapes, eight return the live broadcast (first
  `#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` = now) and only `video.m3u8?utc=<start>&lutc=<now>` starts at the minute
  asked for. `playsAt()` in `providers/rtv.js` follows the variant and compares that clock; the winner
  is remembered under `ARCH_KEY` and put first in the template the player walks (`{from}`, `{dur}`,
  `{now}` are filled in by `PlayerActivity.archiveUrl`).
- **A screen that awaits must check it is still the screen.** `core/requests.js` `guardView(el)` and
  `invalidateView()` exist for this: every view that paints after an `await` (detail, search, live,
  the source list) holds either a guard or the element it is going to write into, and checks
  `isConnected` first. Without it a slow answer paints over whatever the viewer went to next.
- **The player's position is written in `onPause`, not `onStop`.** Android resumes the activity
  underneath before stopping the one being left, and `MainActivity.onResume` is what reads the
  position back — written in `onStop` it always arrived one watching too late.
- **A card over the page is closed by its own button.** `openCard()` is the one definition of "a card
  is up" (`.sheet`, `.update`, a visible `#tstatus`); `boothBack` clicks that card's `[data-back]`
  button rather than removing the element, so Back means what the card's own button means.
- **Kotlin string templates must be plain `$`.** A file once contained `${'$'}{x}` (from a shell heredoc)
  which prints literally: the live banner showed "src.num" and the updater's FileProvider authority was
  wrong. Grep for `'$'` after generating Kotlin from a script.
- **`web.requestFocus()` on a WebView that already has focus steals it**: it re-picks the first focusable
  element and took the caret out of the search box. `showKeyboard()` only requests focus when it has none.
- **A row counts for the D-pad only if something in it is visible** (`tvRows`): a row whose only focusable
  is hidden would swallow Down.
- **`window.BoothAndroid` was deliberately left unrenamed** during the VEO rebrand. It's called
  from hundreds of sites across the page; renaming it is a pure mechanical risk (JS bridge
  calls fail silently at runtime, not at compile time) for zero user-visible benefit, since it's
  never seen by anyone. Leave it as `BoothAndroid` unless there's an actual reason to touch it.
- **A `Runnable` that reschedules itself needs an explicit type.** Kotlin can't infer the type of
  a `val` initializer that references the `val` being defined (self-referential lambda) — declare
  it as `val x: Runnable = Runnable { ...; handler.postDelayed(x, ...) }`.
- **Only one `companion object` per class.** Trivial, but easy to introduce by patching in a new
  block without checking whether one already exists (as happened once with `PlayerActivity`).
- **GitHub's release-asset URLs redirect, sometimes across protocol.** `HttpURLConnection` will
  not follow a redirect that changes protocol; the in-app updater follows redirects itself
  (capped at 5 hops) rather than relying on `setInstanceFollowRedirects(true)`.
- **The legacy add-on URL filter in `js/data/addons.js` (`defaultsRev` migration, search
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/bardalas/MyStreamer1`) must keep the *old* repo name.** It matches a
  URL that is actually stored in existing installs' `localStorage` from before the rename — it is
  describing historical data, not a live pointer, and renaming it to `VEO` would break the
  migration for anyone upgrading from a pre-rename build.
